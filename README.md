# P-G-Case-Competition
P&G is a US-based consumer goods holding company, with a market cap of nearly $318 billion. The company is interested in growing sales and market share in the grooming category, with a focus on the razor segment. Gillette is the leading provider of shaving products, with a 50% market share, and has introduced two new razor products: the "GilletteLabs with Exfoliating Bar" and "Gillette Proglide Value Pack 6up." The challenge is to pitch one of these products to "Downtown Superstore," an established customer of P&G, and show why it would be a valuable addition to their stores.
